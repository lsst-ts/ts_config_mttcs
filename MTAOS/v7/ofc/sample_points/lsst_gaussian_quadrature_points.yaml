# This file stores the Gauss-Legendre quadrature (GQ) points for the LSST field
# The quadrature points are stored in the following format:
# - [field_x, field_y]
# field_x and field_y are in degrees, and they correspond to the field angles
# 
# Note that (0,0) is not really a GQ point but it's weight is zero.
# It is included here only for historical reasons.
