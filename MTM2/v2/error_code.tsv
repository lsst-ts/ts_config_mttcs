# The code matches the bit value of "summary faults status" (64 bits value) from cell controller.
# For example, if the bit 3 is triggered, the error code would be 6051.
# For the codes such as 10XX (e.g. 1000, 1001, etc.), they are just the dummy codes at this moment.

6087	User Identified Error (Emergency Stop)	Fault	Communications	Fault State	The user identifies an error condition that is not detectable via SAL.	A button is created on the EUI to inject a fault to the controller to allow state transitions when the SAL comm link is lost. Since there is no signal available to identify a loss of SAL comm, the state machine is stranded when SAL is lost. This fault kicks the state machine over to the fault state and allows the system to transition to a safe state where comm can be re-initialized. Can also be used to transition the system to the fault state when issues are observed and not captured under existing fault codes
