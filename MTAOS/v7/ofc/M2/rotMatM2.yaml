# Rotation matrix between ZEMAX coordinate and Mirrior's coordinate.
# ZEMAX is used to generate/ evaluate the bending mode.
# Mirror's coordinate is used in the mirror's control system.

# For the Harris's MATLAB and LabVIEW tools:
# The (x, y, z)-axis in MATLAB is (-y, -x, -z) in LabVIEW

# +z in Bo's FEA (ZEMAX) is +z in M2 hardware (LabVIEW).
