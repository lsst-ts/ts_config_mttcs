# Description: Bending mode stresses for M1M3 mirror
#
# bending_mode_stress is the stress in Pa/um (of surface deviation) per bending mode (array of 20 elements)
# A summary of how they were derived can be found in the report

# 
# The stress values we are concerned with regarding glass safety are those describing tensile stress, which 
# are indicated by positive values, whereas compressive stress is indicated by negative values. This is an 
# adopted convention in material mechanics. Tensile stress refers to forces that attempt to pull the material 
# apart, while compressive stress refers to forces that push the material together.
#
# In the case of the M1M3 mirror, the maximum tensile stress for a particular positive bending mode is not 
# necessarily the same as for the negative of that bending mode. For most modes, the maximum tensile stress 
# is almost identical, but for a few, there is a significant difference.
