# The parameters here are used to calculate the rigid body position by the
# reading of independent measurement system (IMS).
# The input is a 12x1 matrix of IMS's reading in mm.
# The order is [A5_thetaZ, A5_deltaZ, A6_thetaZ, A6_deltaZ, A3_thetaZ,
# A3_deltaZ, A4_thetaZ, A4_deltaZ, A1_thetaZ, A1_deltaZ, A2_thetaZ, A2_deltaZ].

# To get the rigid body position, do: output = matrix x (input - offset).

# Offset of the displacement measurement.
# These are the values recoded when the M2 is at the home position.
# This array might need to be updated if the default home position is changed.
# The unit is mm and the order is mentioned above.
