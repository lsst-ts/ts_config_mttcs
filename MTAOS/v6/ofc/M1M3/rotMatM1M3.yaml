# Rotation matrix between ZEMAX coordinate and Mirrior's coordinate.
# ZEMAX is used to generate/ evaluate the bending mode.
# Mirror's coordinate is used in the mirror's control system.

# The FEA coordinate is the optical coordinate system defined in LTS-136.
# +z is defined from M1M3 to M2.

# +z in Bo's FEA (ZEMAX) is +z in M1M3 hardware.
